# sshmusicplayer
possibly the simplest way to remotely play music on your raspberry pi
--well I'm not that sure
what it does is that it exposes a user over SSH that let's you run simple scripts that will play or stop an online radio or alter the volume
it is assiciated with an android app as well that basically logs in over ssh and does what it can
